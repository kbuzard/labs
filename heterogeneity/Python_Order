This file will document how to install and run the Python Scripts in the RamosRivera folder necessary for this project.
This enviroment is only been created for the G drive in my personal computer. 

I) Create a new environment called Test_Jorge on Python:

This procedure creates a local (in your session) environment:

a) In Anaconda Command Prompt typed:
* conda create --name Test_Jorge python=3.7
* conda activate Test_Jorge

b) Install the packages in Anaconda Command Prompt:
* conda install -c esri arcgis
* conda install -c conda-forge mkl-service
* conda install -c conda-forge plotnine
* conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
* conda install -c conda-forge geopy
* conda install -c conda-forge opencv-python
* conda install -c conda-forge pytesseract
* conda install -c conda-forge pyap
* conda install -c conda-forge tabulate
* conda install -c conda-forge openpyxls (if do not work try "pip install openpyxls")

Note: Every time you need to install a new package, do it in Anaconda Command Prompt.

c) Go to the "Anaconda Navigator" on the Start Menu:

* On Anaconda Navigator go to environment and select "Test_Jorge" 
* Once "Test_Jorge" is installed, go to Home and install "Spyder". If "Spyder" is already installed, then click "Launch".

d) In Spyder, open the script you need. 

Note: If Spyder gets stuck on "connecting to kernel", then close Spyder and do the following:
i) Go to "Environments" in the Anaconda Navigator.
ii) Search for pyzmq
iii) Click on the green tick box and select version 16.0.4
iv) Click on "Apply"
v) Reopen Spyder

Now you have set up your environment. Go to Spyder and run the scripts. 

II) Order of the Python Scripts. 

Diagram for Clarification
 
First, all the python scripts are located in:
G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\Labs-kbuzard-S18\Admin\ramosRivera\T-Burk\Python Scripts

To help understand what we are doing is good to start with the intuition of the procedure. 
First, we are digitalizing the addresses of the labs. 
Second, we are Geocoding those address to be able to locate them in a map using ArcMap. 
Third, we are creating the clusters by running simulations. 
Fourth, we are calculating the agglomerations effects. 

In order to carry out the above four tasks the python scripts should be run in the following order:

Chain to run:
Pdf2Jpg.py --> OCR.py --> pngwork.py --> Address_ID.py --> state_code_rep.py --> GeoCoder.py -->  field_org.py --> Shapify.py--> K-function Local_3Stage.py--> stat_calc.py
